# c-to-pascal-translator

This project contains a simple awk script that translates simple C programs into Pascal programs.

As the first input argument, the program takes the name of the C code file, and as the second argument it takes the name of the file into which to insert the code translated into Pascal.

!!! The script works fine with AWK 4.1.4, but is not compatible with version 5.
